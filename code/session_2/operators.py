# ----- 1. Basic perators -----

# x = 7
# y = 2

# print("x substracted by y equals to: ", x-y)
# print("Floor division of x by y: ", x//y) # 7/2 = 3.5. "Floor" of a real number: the largest integer less than or equal to the number
# print("Modulus of x by y: ", x%y) # This gives back the remainder. Here: 7 = 2 * 3 + 1; the remainder is 1

# ----- 2. Augmented assignment operators -----
# x = 10
# print("The value of x is:", x)
# x *= 2
# print("The new value of x is:", x)
