# A bad string: This call of the print function  won't work
# print("Print out a backslash: \")

# Using "\" to escape the slash:
# print("Print out a backslash: \\")
# print("Print out even more backslashes: \\\\\\\\")

# Similarly, you can also use "\" to escape quotation marks:
# print("the project \"Programming for Everybody\"")
# print('the project \'Programming for Everybody\'')
