# ----- 1. Bad printing -----
# print("the project "Programming for Everybody"")

# ----- 2. Deal with quote inside strings -----
# print('the project "Programming for Everybody"')
# print("the project 'Programming for Everybody'")

# ----- 3. Triple quotes -----
# print("""
# the project "Programming for Everybody"
# """)

## 3.1 Strings spanning over multiple lines:

# print("""
#     WHITE RABBIT:
#     They told me you had been to her,
#     And mentioned me to him;
#     She gave me a good character,
#     But said I could not swim.
# """)

## 3.2 Note what the following triple quotation mark does:

# print("here I print something...")
# """
# print
# """
