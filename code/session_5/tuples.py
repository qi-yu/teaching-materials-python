import random

# ----- 1. Construct a tuple -----
employee_names = ("Dr. Cat", "Anna", "Eva")
# print(employee_names)
# print(type(employee_names))

## Tuples with elements in different data types:
# work_days_cat = ("Dr. Cat", 30, 0, 0)
# employee_infos = (("Dr. Cat", 0, "researcher"),
#                   ("Anna", 5, "lab manager"),
#                   ("Eva", 1, "student assistant"))

## Print out the elements one by one using a for-loop:
# for item in employee_infos:
#     print(item)

# It is also possible to construct an empty tuple:
# employee_names = ()
# print(employee_names)

# ----- 2. Tuple mutability -----
# employee_names = ("Dr. Cat", "Anna", "Eva")
# employee_names[0] = "Prof. Dr. Cat" # This won't work. Tuples are immutable.
