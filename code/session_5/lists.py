# ----- 1. Construct a list -----
# employee_names = ("Dr. Cat", "Anna", "Eva")
# Print out the list:
# print(employee_names)

## Print out the elements one by one using a for-loop:
# for name in employee_names:
#     print(name)

# print(type(employee_names))

## Nested list:
# work_days = [["Dr. Cat", 30, 0, 0],
#              ["Anna", 30, 23, 25],
#              ["Eva", 30, 20, 28]
#              ]  # You can also choose to write all elements in the same line.
#
# for item in work_days:
#     print("ITEM:", item, "\t\tType:", type(item))

# Construct an empty list:
# employee_names = []
# print(employee_names)

# ----- 2. List mutability -----
# employee_names = ["Dr. Cat", "Anna", "Eva"]
# print("OLD LIST: ", employee_names)
#
# employee_names[0] = "Prof. Dr. Cat"
# print("NEW LIST: ", employee_names)
