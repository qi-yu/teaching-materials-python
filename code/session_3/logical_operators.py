# ----- 1. Logical operators -----
boolean1 = True
boolean2 = False

# print(not boolean1)
# print(boolean1 and boolean2)
# print(boolean1 or boolean2)

## For combination of logical operators: Use parentheses to clarify the scope of operations.
# boolean1 = True
# boolean2 = False
#
# combination_1 = not boolean1 and boolean2
# combination_2 = not (boolean1 and boolean2)
#
# print(combination_1)
# print(combination_2)

# ----- 2. Using logical operators to create compound conditions: -----
# print("This program helps you to make decision for your leisure activities.\n")
#
# whether = input("""How is the weather today?
#
#                    1 - sunny
#                    2 - cloudy / rainy
#
#                    """)
#
# mood = input("""How is your mood today?
#
#             1 - I feel happy
#             2 - I feel a bit down
# """)
#
# print("My suggestions: \n")
#
# if whether == "1" and (mood == "1" or mood == "2"):
#     print("Sounds like you'll have a nice day! Maybe go for a drink after the work?")
# #elif whether == "1" and mood == "2":
#  #   print("Go for a walk and get some sunshine. The sunlight helps with depressing mood!")
# elif whether == "2" and mood == "1":
#     print("Sometimes it's a great feeling to just chill at home.")
